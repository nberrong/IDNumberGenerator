ID Number Generator

Description

This project evolved from a Code Kentucky cohort group exercise to generate a random number in the format of a Social Security number. I expanded on this to learn more about programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The Generator allows the user to enter the first and last name of an individual. The program will then assign a Social Security-like number to the inputed name, provided that one has not been assigned already. This search is NOT case sensitive. The program then generates a "card" for that person and adds it to the screen. A button allows all the cards to be cleared.

Future implementations could include:
• Restricting the name input to only letters, dashes, and apostrophes.
• Fixing the alert that shows the name of the person in all lowercase.
• Fixing the title case for common capitalization issues (Mcdonald, O'neil, etc.)
• Allowing a table view rather than a card view.
• Save the data into local storage or a database.
